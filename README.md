### :man_technologist: About me:

I am a trainee-level software developer. My journey started in May 2023. The first course that I started was <a src="https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/">Harvard's CS50P</a> by David J. Malan.
In addition, I started my studies at St.Petersburg's Polytechnical College.
